# **Burger**

Burger is a fun web app that allows users to "place an order" (for the burger they are craving) and "devour it!" The app runs using server-side scripting with Node.js and the Express.js web application framework. It also uses a MySQL database to store the burger orders placed and devoured. Burger is deployed on Heroku!

## **Burger:**

To use the Burger app click on this link: [Burger](https://boiling-woodland-75803.herokuapp.com/) . Make a burger order using the "Place Order Here" field. When you hit "Add a Burger," your order will appear in the upper left hand corner of the app. Click "Devoured!" to toss it over to the "Decoured" column at right.
